# SnakeGame
This project is a Snake game in C# without using a game engine. The snake game is an action-based video game
where the player maneuvers a snake or line of blocks, the player must gather dots in order to grow their snake.
The longer the snake, the better, and when the whole screen is full, the player wins. But if the snake hits itself
the player loses.
